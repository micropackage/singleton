## ðŸ“¦ About the Micropackage project

Micropackages - as the name suggests - are micro packages with a tiny bit of reusable code, helpful particularly in WordPress development.

The aim is to have multiple packages which can be put together to create something bigger by defining only the structure.

Micropackages are maintained by [BracketSpace](https://bracketspace.com).
